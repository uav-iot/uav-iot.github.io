## Scope
{: style="color:#32a852"}

The objective of this workshop is to bring together researchers, engineers, and practitioners from academia and industry to share their latest research findings and practical experiences in the area of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and its synergy with Internet of Things (IoT). The workshop will provide a platform to discuss the challenges and opportunities of UAVs and IoT integration, their applications, and their impact on various domains such as transportation, agriculture, healthcare, and environmental monitoring. 
Over the past decade, advances in Internet of Things, edge computing and wireless communication have led to the evolution of advanced form of smart systems to utilize our resources intelligently. Originated from RFID and wireless sensor networks (WSNs), the paradigm of IoT has been transforming every aspect of human life including healthcare, energy, transportation, manufacturing and entertainment. Recently, the rapid development of UAVs, like aerial drones, or any other automated carriers on road, has highlighted a plethora of emergent applications such as infrastructure inspection, surveillance, smart agriculture, search and rescue, parcel delivery, communications, post-disaster recovery, and many more. In all these applications UAVs may coexist and synergize with Internet of Things (IoT). For energy-constrained sensor devices of IoT, UAVs may collect the data and communicate it to other devices that are out of the communication ranges. Also, using IoT technologies, UAVs may autonomously perform remote sensing relaying either the raw data by the sensors, or an aggregated view using edge computing to reduce latency and communication overhead. Additionally, one or more UAVs can collaborate to provide services that require efficient protocols where multiple objectives and constraints need to be considered. Moreover, with the rising concern of global warming, care should be taken to make these emerging applications green, sustainable and eco-friendly.

This workshop will consider the research works that combine the design of algorithms and testbed implementations to develop the theoretical foundations for UAVs as well as the synergies with IoT devices.
